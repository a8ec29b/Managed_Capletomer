## Capletomer
Capletomer ~~(remoteLPAC)~~ is a http api for https://github.com/estkme-group/lpac  
Managed by ChatGPT.   
~~Multi devices (may, perhaps, possibly, or probably) be supported in the far future~~  

### Usage  
You need to compile LPAC first (https://github.com/estkme-group/lpac/blob/main/docs/DEVELOPERS.md). 
For Wifi dongles with Qualcomm 410 built in, perhaps the legacy version of README of https://github.com/damonto/telegram-sms may help.  
  
Currently this project is extremely unstable and is limited to simulation under Windows.
